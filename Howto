How to use the R SGF viewer

1. define variable sgf_file to the SGF file you want to see, with path
   
   sgf_file = 'C:/temp/somefile.sgf'


2. download the "goplot.txt" library, which contains all the functions; initialize the parsing "engine" 
   and the necessary functions by loading it with 'source'

   source("goplot.txt")


3. use the following functions: 
  - newplot() to initialize the graph, 
  - placehandi() to initialize the handicap stones,
  - playnext() to play one move at a time. 
  
  
A typical sequence of commands:

newplot()
placehandi()
playnext()
playnext()
...
playnext()
