#Howto
- define variable sgf_file to the SGF file you want to see, with path
sgf_file = 'C:/temp/somefile.sgf'

 - download the "goplot.txt" library, which contains all the functions to plot a SGF file
 
 - initialize the parsing "engine" and the necessary functions with the command source (e.g. if you copy goplot.txt in your workspace, type just:)
source("goplot.txt")

- use the following functions: newplot() to initialize the graph, placehandi() to initialize the handicap stones,
playnext() to play one move at a time. A typical sequence of command would be:
newplot()
placehandi()
playnext()
playnext()
...
playnext()
