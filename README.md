# R_sgf_viewer
a SGF viewer written in R

Feel free to use it for quick replays of games without leaving your favourite statistical software!

Known issues: 
 - only 19x19 board size is supported
 - only single-branch SGF files are supported.  This means that files with variations will be accurate only up to the first variation
 - the orientation of the board may be non-standard (AA should be the upper left corner)

Coming next: 
 - support for various board sizes
 - support for variations
 - faster ways to replay
